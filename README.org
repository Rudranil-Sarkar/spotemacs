#+AUTHOR: Rudranil Sarkar


This is a package provides a minor mode for controlling spotify client through Emacs. It does it by hooking into the D-Bus interface of spotify. So the other than linux it may not work.

* Keybindings
All keybindings are prefixed by ~C-x C-s~. Which can be changed from the customization UI.

| Keybindings | Function           |
|-------------+--------------------|
| p           | Play / Pause Track |
| P           | Previous Track     |
| n           | Next Track         |
| c           | Change Playlist    |
| a           | Add a playlist     |

* Adding Playlists
Currently Adding playlist is kinda hassle. You have to provide the playlist url and playlist name yourself. I am working on adding the oauth support to automatically fetch your playlists.
